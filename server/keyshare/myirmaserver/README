This server provides the primary end points for the myirma web interface. 

Although this server permits the user to delete his account, and change email address associations, for security reasons, deletion of account logs and email addresses is delayed. Deleting an email address marks it as to be deleted, but only does so after 30 days to stop someone who has stolen a phone from making it impossible to disable the IRMA account. Similarly, when deleting an account, logs remain stored and accessible through email login for 30 days, to stop attackers from erasing their tracks.
